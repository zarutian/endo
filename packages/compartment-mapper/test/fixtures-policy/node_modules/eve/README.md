this package is called eve not mallory, because it's attempting to ensure that if identifying packages for the sake of policy enfocement is not tricked by the override `"dan": "hackity"` it specifies. Just in case we don't get a false negative from the test, both 'eve' and 'dan' are shorter names than the alternative path that's the correct one: `alice>hackity`
