This package is called `eve` not `mallory`, because it's attempting to ensure that the algorithm for identifying packages is not tricked by the override `"dan": "hackity"` it specifies. Just in case we don't get a false negative from the test, both `eve` and `dan` are shorter names than the alternative path that's the correct one: `alice>hackity` or `eve>hackity`
