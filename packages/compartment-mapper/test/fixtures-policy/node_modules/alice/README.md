Main app imports a file from this package that's not its main, therefore reaching the scoped module logic in linking.

Simultaneously package.json defines a browser override for the file attempting to redirect to a package, but the override is invalid and should not work. There's a test meant to assert it keeps causing an error instead of successfully importing a neighbor package.
